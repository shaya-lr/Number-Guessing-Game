This project is a simple **Number Guessing Game** implemented in Python.

### How It Works
1. The program generates a random number within a specified range.
2. The player tries to guess the number, and the game provides feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
3. The game continues until the correct number is guessed, and it displays the number of attempts made.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### How to Run
1. Run the Python script in your environment.
2. Follow the prompts to guess the number!
